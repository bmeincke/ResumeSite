                    <p>Role: <strong>Lead Software Developer</strong></p>
                    <p>Duration: Sep 2023 - Apr 2024</p>
                    <p>Description:<br> 
					For my Senior Capstone Project, my team and I developed an appointment scheduling system for a barbershop client. The previous system was not tailored to the business's specific requirements, resulting in issues with wait times and customer retention. Our team designed a user-friendly time slotting system for barbers and customers alike. Additionally, we implemented a loyalty program based on the number of haircuts a customer received annually, providing discounts on every 12th haircut to incentivize repeat business.
					<br>
					In my role as Lead Developer on the project team, I was responsible for overseeing the development process,
					assigning tasks to team members, and managing content within our web-based application. I collaborated closely
					with a partner throughout the development phase to refine the app and ensure its functionality. Upon completion of
					the development phase, I coordinated testing and debugging efforts among team members, assigning specific
					functions for testing and promptly addressing and resolving any identified bugs to ensure the application's optimal
					performance.
					<br> 
					We utilized FlutterFlow and Firebase technologies for our project. FlutterFlow is a web-based platform tailored for
					native mobile and web application development. Firebase serves as an integrated database service within
					FlutterFlow, ensuring seamless data integration and management. Together, these technologies provided the
					essential frontend and backend framework required for our application to operate effectively. <br>
					(NOTE: Trieu's Barbershop is developing the application further before utilizing it on their site)</p>
