                    <p><strong>Bachelors Degree in Information Technology with a Concentration in Web Application Development</strong></p>
                    <p>I started my journey at George Mason University in the fall of 2019. I came into Mason as a Cyber Security major, but decided after a year that I wanted to pivot into general IT. I started taking IT courses my sophomore year and found my passion for Web Development through the courses I took. GMU offered a holistic approach to IT in its degree requirements, equipping me with skills in many fields of IT. Throughout my time at Mason, I took courses covering topics such as: Cyber Security, Web Design, Networking, Application Development, Cloud Development, Database Management, Data Analytics/Visualizations, and more. I feel I really found my niche in Web Design/Web Application Development. Upon declaring my concentration, my courses shifted focus on building websites and web applications.</p>
